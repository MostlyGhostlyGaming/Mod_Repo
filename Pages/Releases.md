## 

Just a warning, I am not responsible for anything wrong that goes on when these mods are activated (that includes computer damage from Minecraft, emotional damage, etc)

Another thing, this is NOT a virus. if you think I'm lying, run the file through antivirus software of some kind. 

Also also, I would suggest at least a mid-range computer to run these mods. These mods are heavy and it will not run well on a low-end computer. on my relatively mid-range computer, I was redlining my memory when the stream was happening. If you are planning to stream with this enabled, DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 

NOTE: Install the .rar file attached to this post. DO NOT INSTALL SOURCE CODE! It is not the right files. Also, the Skyrim Soundpack will be attached too.

*P.S. I do not own any of these mods. all credit goes to their respective owners.*
